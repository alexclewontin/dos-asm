# dos-asm

This repository contains assembly code written for an 8086 running MS-DOS, written as part of a class I took. 

As the course is still offered by the institution at which I took it, I have organized this repository so that the `main` branch (the default branch) is empty, and the code is in the
`code` branch. This way, while I can direct people to this repository and my code as part of a portfolio, the code itself (and thus the answers to the projects) are not indexed by Github's search.
It is my crude attempt at creating a Github equivalent of Youtube's "Unlisted" setting.
